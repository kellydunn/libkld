# what

My personal implementations of some common datastructures in the C programming language.

Because why not.

# installation

```
git clone git@github.com/kellydunn/libkld
cd libkld
make 
sudo make install
```

This will result in a static library: `/usr/lib/libkld.a`

# structs

Currently, `libkld` has the following data structures:

  - list
  - vector
  - matrix

Eventually, I'd like to have the following implemented with common operations:

  - graph
